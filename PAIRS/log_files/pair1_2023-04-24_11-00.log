Welcome to PAIRS. Your mission is to identify matching letters in the grid.
Good luck. If you give up at any point, just use q to quit.

The uncovered table:

     1    2    3    4
1:  [E]  [C]  [B]  [D] 
2:  [G]  [F]  [D]  [H] 
3:  [A]  [C]  [H]  [F] 
4:  [A]  [E]  [G]  [B] 

1. move: (1,1)=-E, (1,2)=-C [slot1=1,1, slot2=1,2]
2. move: (1,3)=-B, (1,4)=-D [slot1=1,3, slot2=1,4]
3. move: (2,1)=-G, (2,2)=-F [slot1=2,1, slot2=2,2]
4. move: (2,3)=-D, (2,4)=-H [slot1=2,3, slot2=2,4]
5. move: (2,3)=-D, (1,4)=-D [slot1=2,3, slot2=1,4]
6. move: (3,1)=-A, (3,2)=-C [slot1=3,1, slot2=3,2]
7. move: (1,2)=-C, (3,2)=-C [slot1=1,2, slot2=3,2]
8. move: (3,3)=-H, (3,4)=-F [slot1=3,3, slot2=3,4]
9. move: (3,3)=-H, (2,4)=-H [slot1=3,3, slot2=2,4]
Congratulations! You uncovered all the pairs in 10 attempts.
